This document describes manifest for ZeroVM NaCl application.
update: a new design
-------------------------------------------------------------


Description:
The manifest is a text file which must be provided in order to run a NaCl application inside ZeroVM. 
Manifest samples can be found in "samples" directory.

list of available keywords:
Version
Program
Channel
Memory
Timeout
Node
Etag
NameServer

Structure:
- each valid line must contain exactly only one key and value(s) separated by exactly one '=' sign
- both key and value may contain spaces
- key and value case does matter: "key" and "KeY" are treated as a different keywords
- spaces around key/value will be ignored
- lines are delimited with EOL (unix or windows style)
- invalid lines will be ignored
- lines with unknown keywords (not mentioned below) will be ignored
- "Channel" expects complex values: comma separated fields 

List of valid keywords:
Channel
  (obligatory, 7 comma separated fields strings and integers)
  Description of a channel. The order does matter. example:
  Channel = /home/dazo/git/zerovm/samples/sort/sort.stdout.log, /dev/stdout, 5, 0, 0, 99999999, 99999999
  where: 
    [1] trusted channel name (n/a for the user), 
    [2] untrusted channel name, 
    [3] access type, 
    [4] gets limit, 
    [5] get size limits, 
    [6] puts limit, 
    [7] put size limits
  Each manifest SHOULD have at least three Channel configuration entries for the standard devices: stdin, stdout, stderr
  Example (maps all channels to /dev/null):
    Channel = /dev/null, /dev/stdin, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
    Channel = /dev/null, /dev/stdout, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
    Channel = /dev/null, /dev/stderr, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
  network channels has same fields, but the very 1st one (trusted channel name) has special form:
  protocol:address:port
  where
    protocol can be tcp (or udp for name server)
    address is IPv4 or integer representaion of it
    port is 16 bit integer or empty (if name server used)
  
Version
  (obligatory, string)
  currently ZeroVM is not backward compatible with the older manifest versions.
  working version is 09082012
Program
  (obligatory, string)
  NaCl module to validate and run, full path
Timeout
  (obligatory, unsigned 32-bit integer)
  time out in seconds. ZeroVM will stop user program and exit after the specified period
Memory
  (obligatory, unsigned 32-bit integer)
  Specifies the memory size in bytes available for the user program. If specified
  ZeroVM will allocate all memory before nexe start and will not use real memory
  allocation syscalls due nexe runtime. MemMax should take in account that 16mb should be
  reserved for the user stack, 1mb+ - for nexe code and data, and some memory for system area
NameServer
  (optional, string)
  the address of name server. name server resolves zerovm provided network channels.
  only supported protocol is udp. notation used to specify the address is not standard
  since 1. it is internal thing, 2. it is more simple to parse such pseudo url. the
  same notation used for network channels.
  NameServer = udp:127.0.0.1:54321
  udp - protocol
  127.0.0.1 - server ip address
  54321 - server port
  note: it is possible to use integer ip representation instead of IPv4
Node
  (optional, unsigned 32-bit integer)
  Specifies the node id (not available for the untrusted code). The node id should 
  be greater then 0.
  Example:
  NodeName = 1
Etag
  (optional, single value)
  reserved

Both keywords and values have size limit of 64kb. The manifest file size limited
to 0x100000. The limitations can be changed in the future.
