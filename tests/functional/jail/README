this test is obsolette and should be replaced with the new one: mprotect

subjects to tests:
read only protection of area (should be ok)
read/write protection of area (should be ok)
read/execute protection of area (should be ok)
read/write/execute protection of area (should fail)
e.t.c.

comments about validation:
after test finished, report show something like this:
validator state = 3
daemon = 0
user return code = 0
memtag = disabled
accounting = 0.00 0.03 6 34448 30 2003 0 0 0 0
exit state = ok
command = /home/bortoq/git/zerovm/zerovm[59263] jail.manifest

"validator state = 3" means there were 3 unsuccessful attempts to mark
memory areas as "executable". this is ok for this test
